# certsync
Manually synchronize X509v3 certificates to multiple local keystores (Mozilla/NSS, OSX Keychain, files)

Built in an environment with an enterprise directory (with certificates), Apple Mac OSX and iOS apps
needing certificates in keychains, and Mozilla products needing certificates in the NSS stores.

NSS support requires Mozilla's NSS tools already installed.
